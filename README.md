# PERCEPTIVE
PERCEPTIVE is an R Shiny based graphical interface for the prediction and annotation of chromatin modifiying enzymes in novel or poorly studied species. PERCEPTIVE applies heuristic models and model species information to make predictions and provides end users with a graphical interpretation of the data.
PERCEPTIVE is broken into two graphical R functions, Pipeline and App. 
The Pipeline function encompasses the entirety of the annotation pipeline (from unassembled genome to predictions). This function will ONLY run in a linux environment, and requires several additional dependencies be downloaded from gdrive.
The App function encompasses the entirety of the data visualization and prediction tool. This tool is agnostic of operating system, and should run on any OS with support for R, and basic CRAN packages.

## Installation
First determine if you are a pipeline user or an app user. Installation will be broken down based on user case.
## Dependencies commond to both functions
Follow these directions irrespective of which function you intend to use.
### Rstudio and R
Both the Pipeline and App functions require a current version of R to be installed, and the R devtools package to download and install PERCEPTIVE from github. 
Here we recommend that users download and install Rstudio (which for some operating systems includes R), found [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for easier graphical interfacing, and R version 4.4 (Pile of Leaves). R version 4.4.x can be found for Windows OS [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), and Linux and OS X (Darwin) [here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/).
### R devtools
Once you have installed R, start an R terminal using the R GUI, or open RStudio (the terminal can be found at the bottom left corner). Run the following command:
'install.packages("devtools")'.
